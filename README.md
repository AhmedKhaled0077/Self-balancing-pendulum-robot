# Self-balancing-pendulum-robot
## Overview
Welcome to the Self-Balancing Pendulum Robot project! This repository contains the mechanical design files created in SolidWorks for a unique and innovative self-balancing robot. The robot is designed to maintain its balance on a single pendulum while navigating its environment.

## Features
SolidWorks Design: 
The mechanical design of the robot has been meticulously crafted using SolidWorks, ensuring precision and reliability in the construction process.

Self-Balancing Capability: Equipped with advanced sensors and control algorithms, the robot can dynamically adjust its position on the pendulum to maintain stability, showcasing the principles of inverted pendulum control.

##Open Source:
This project is entirely open source, encouraging collaboration and community involvement. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to the development of the robot.
